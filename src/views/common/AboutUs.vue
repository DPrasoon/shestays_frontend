            SheStays is a web portal especially designed for the female
            students and working professionals who are in search for hostels or
            PGs in different cities to stay there. Here all the Hostel and PG
            owner can send us data to show case their Hostels and PGs. We also
            list out facilities provided by each accomodation. Any needy can
            search them and can get connected with owners for further
            communication. It is a very useful platform for every women who
            wants to search Hostels and PGs without wondering here and there.
          </p>
          <p>
            All the Hostels and PG details are authentic and verified by our
            Area Managers, and review of the properties will also be provided by
            them, in reference to the safety of women. Each city will have their
            own female managers.

        <h6 class="section-body">
          <p>
            As students or outsiders it is very difficult to search a place
            for accommodation manually in unknown city where we do not know
            anyone or do not have idea of that city. Morever, finding a safe
            locality for women is a difficult task. We need to ask individuals
            or might be visit many places in search of a good Hostel or PG. This
            is a very tiring and boring task.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also it is very difficult for Hostel and PG owners to promote their
            business manually. For promotion of their business they also need a
            global platform where they can show their services. To increase
            their client they should have a platform to promote themselves.
          </p>
          <p>
            To overcome these types of problems from both ends, this portal
            comes into existence.
